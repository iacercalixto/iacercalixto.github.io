  abstract: >
     In this paper we describe a new method for estimating origin–destination (OD) matrices for congested urban traffic networks. It is assumed that the input data includes incomplete, imprecise estimates of: link counts, trip table entries, numbers of departures from origins and numbers of arrivals at destinations. The method is based on a sequence of fuzzy linear programs and is designed especially for the particular characteristics of medium-to-large Brazilian cities. When there doesn’t exist a user–equilibrium traffic assignment that corresponds to the input data, the method provides a range of traffic assignments and their related OD matrices, within the spectrum of (i) satisfaction of the inputted estimates and (ii) a user–equilibrium assignment. The method has been tested on two numerical examples, one proposed by the authors and the other a classic one from the literature.
