    We present a doubly-attentive multimodal machine translation model. Our model learns to attend to source language and spatial-preserving CONV5,4 visual features as separate attention mechanisms in a neural translation model. In image description translation experiments (Task 1), we find an improvement of 2.3 Meteor points compared to initialising the hidden state of the decoder with only the FC7 features and 2.9 Meteor points compared to a text-only neural machine translation baseline, confirming the useful nature of attending to the CONV5,4 features.

    Motivated by the adage that a “picture is worth a thousand words” it can be reasoned that automatically enriching the textual content of a document with relevant images can increase the readability of a document. Moreover, features extracted from the additional image data inserted into the textual content of a document may, in principle, be also be used by a retrieval engine to better match the topic of a document with that of a given query. In this paper, we describe our approach of building a ground truth dataset to enable further research into automatic addition of relevant images to text documents. The dataset is comprised of the official ImageCLEF 2010 collection (a collection of images with textual metadata) to serve as the images available for automatic enrichment of text, a set of 25 benchmark documents that are to be enriched, which in this case are children’s short stories, and a set of manually judged relevant images for each query story obtained by the standard procedure of depth pooling. We use this benchmark dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of standard information retrieval methods as simple baselines for this task. The results indicate that using the whole story as a weighted query, where the weight of each query term is its tf-idf value, achieves an precision of 0.1714 within the top 5 retrieved images on an average.
