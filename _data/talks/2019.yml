  about: |
    This summer school on Translation Technologies was organised in the Faculty of Arts of the Universidade do Porto, in Portugal. I have given two talks, one where I discussed statistical and the other neural machine translation. I discussed the technical challenges in machine translation, and the assumptions that statistical and neural models make. I showed architectures for both non-attentive and attentive neural MT models, and discussed how they work and why they work. I also conducted a session in the afternoon where I showed how to train and use a trained model to translate new sentences. This afternoon session was more interactive, and we used a cluster in the University of Amsterdam with GPUs in a live session.
