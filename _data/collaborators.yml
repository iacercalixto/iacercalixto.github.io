  about: >
    I was lead engineer in a project with *eBay Inc.* between 2016 and 2017 as part of the ADAPT Centre,
    and worked under Andy's supervision.
    We studied the application of multi-modal neural machine translation to translating eBay's product listings.
    Two joint publications came out of it, and you can find the papers 
    [here](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E17-2101) (EACL) and
    [here](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-2004) (Vision&Language Workshop).

  about: >
      I met Lucia in classes she taught during my Erasmus Mundus master (in NLP&HLT) in 2012, in Wolverhampton.
      Later in that year, I worked with Lucia in an [EPRSC project](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/L.Specia/projects/vlnet.html)
      where we started studying how to use images in machine translation (before it was cool:).
      More recently, in 2017, I spent two weeks collaborating with her group funded by the [Integrating Vision&Language COST Action](https://ivl-net.eu/), working on multi-task learning for NMT.
