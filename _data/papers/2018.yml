  abstract: >
    In this article, we conduct an extensive qualitative error analysis of different multi-modal neural machine translation (MNMT) models which integrate visual features into different parts of both the encoder and the decoder.
    We investigate how different training data availability scenarios impact different models, and analyse translations from German into English: in a first scenario, (i) there is only a small training data set of parallel sentence pairs with images, or (ii) in addition to that there are additional image descriptions in the target language with images, which are incorporated with back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016).
    We analyse two different types of MNMT models, that use global and local image features: the latter encode an image globally, i.e. there is one feature vector computed for an entire image, whereas the former encode spatial information, i.e. there are multiple feature vectors, each encoding different portions of the image.
    We conduct an extensive error analysis of translations generated by different multi-modal NMT models as well as text-only baselines, where we study how multi-modal models compare when translating both visual and non-visual terms.
    In general, we find that the additional multi-modal signals consistently improve translations, even more so when using simpler multi-modal NMT models that use global visual features, and also that not only translations of terms with a strong visual connotation are improved, but almost all kinds of errors decreased by using (some) multi-modal models and more training data.
