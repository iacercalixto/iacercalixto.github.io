  abstract  = {We introduce multi-modal, attention-based neural machine translation (NMT)
        models which incorporate visual features into different parts of both the
        encoder and the decoder. Global image features are extracted using a
        pre-trained convolutional neural network and are incorporated (i) as words in
        the source sentence, (ii) to initialise the encoder hidden state, and (iii) as
        additional data to initialise the decoder hidden state. In our experiments, we
        evaluate translations into English and German, how different strategies to
        incorporate global image features compare and which ones perform best. We also
        study the impact that adding synthetic multi-modal, multilingual data brings
        and find that the additional data have a positive impact on multi-modal NMT
        models. We report new state-of-the-art results and our best models also
        significantly improve on a comparable phrase-based Statistical MT (PBSMT) model
        trained on the Multi30k data set according to all metrics evaluated. To the
        best of our knowledge, it is the first time a purely neural model significantly
        improves over a PBSMT model on all metrics evaluated on this data set.},
