I am co-organizing Repl4NLP 2021 and am Area Chair for EACL 2021.

I review manuscripts for the most important journals in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Translation &amp; Natural Language Processing:

* [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence/)
* [Machine Translation](https://link.springer.com/journal/10590)
* [Computational Linguistics](http://cljournal.org)
* [Natural Language Engineering](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering)
* [IEEE Transactions on Multimedia](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6046)
* [IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5962385)
* [MDPI Sensors](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors)
* Among others.

I also usually serve in the Programme Committee and review for many top-tier conferences in my research field:
