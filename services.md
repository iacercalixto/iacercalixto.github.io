I am co-organizing Repl4NLP 2021 and am Area Chair for EACL 2021.

I review manuscripts for the most important journals in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Translation &amp; Natural Language Processing:

* [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence/)
* [Machine Translation](https://link.springer.com/journal/10590)
* [Computational Linguistics](http://cljournal.org)
* [Natural Language Engineering](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/natural-language-engineering)
* Among others.

I also usually serve in the Programme Committee and review for many top-tier conferences in my research field:

* International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR): [2020](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2020)
* Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL): [2018](https://acl2018.org/), [2019](http://www.acl2019.org/EN/index.xhtml), [2020](https://acl2020.org/).
* North-American Chapter Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL): [2019](https://naacl2019.org/).
* Empirical Methods for Natural Language Processing (EMNLP): [2018](https://emnlp2018.org/), [2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/).
