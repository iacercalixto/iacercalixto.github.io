Between 2019 and 2022 I was a [Marie Skwodówska-Curie Global Fellow][msca_gf]
working on the **[IMAGINE][imagine]**: *Improving Multi-modal lAnguage Generation wIth world kNowledgE* project,
which was a research project to investigate how to incorporate **world knowledge** into
**vision &amp; language** tasks within **natural language generation**.

I spent ~2 years in New York University's [Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences][nyu_cims]
where I worked with [Kyunghyun Cho][cho], and 1 year at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)][illc] in the University of Amsterdam,
where I worked with [Raquel Fernández][raquel].
