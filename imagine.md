I have been granted a [Marie Skwodówska-Curie Global Fellowship][msca_gf],
which will fund my research for about 3 years.
The name of my project is **IMAGINE: Improving Multi-modal lAnguage Generation wIth world kNowledgE**,
and its main goal is to investigate how to incorporate **world knowledge** into
**vision &amp; language** tasks within **natural language generation**.

I will spend ~2 years in New York University's [Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences][nyu_cims]
where I will work with [Kyunghyun Cho][cho], followed by 3 months in Paris visiting [Antoine Bordes][abordes] in 
[Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)][fair].
I will finally return to the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)][illc] in the University of Amsterdam,
where I will continue collaborating with [Raquel Fernández][raquel].

Concretely, I will investigate how to:
* Gather world-knowledge automatically from publicly available multi-modal knowledge bases.
* Learn representations for a knowledge base that encompasses both text and images.
* Integrate this knowledge into multi-modal language generation tasks, such as
multi-modal machine translation, visual question answering and image description generation.

Please [get in touch](mailto:iacer.calixto@nyu.edu) with you would like to collaborate on any of these research topics!
