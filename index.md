* 2019-2023 [Multi3Generation][multi3generation]: Multi-task, Multilingual, Multimodal Language Generation. **EU COST Action**

# News
* **Mai/2022** I am hiring a PhD student for the project [Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning for Healthcare](https://werkenbij.amsterdamumc.org/en/vacatures/research/phd-natural-language-processing-and-machine-learning-for-healthcare). We accept applications until June 12, 2022!

* **Mar/2022** I am hiring a PhD student for the project [Responsible Natural Language Processing and Data Management for Mental Health](https://vacatures.uva.nl/UvA/job/PhD-Position-in-Responsible-Natural-Language-Processing-and-Data-Management-for-Mental-Health/742588302/). Applications closed! 

* **Mar/2022** Our paper [*VALSE: A Task-Independent Benchmark for Vision and Language Models Centered on Linguistic Phenomena*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07566) was accepted for publication at **ACL 2022**. We investigate to what extent existing pretrained vision-and-language models ground text on vision and vice-versa using a counterfactual approach and focusing on fine-grained linguistic phenomena! ([code and data](https://github.com/Heidelberg-NLP/VALSE))

* **Feb/2022** I am tenure-track Assistant Professor of AI in Medicine in the Department of Medical Informatics, [Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam][amc]!

* **Nov/2021** Our paper [*VisualSem: A High-quality Knowledge Graph for Vision & Language*](https://aclanthology.org/2021.mrl-1.13.pdf) was accepted for publication at the 'Multilingual Representation Learning' (**MRL 2021**) Workshop. We created a dataset to support research in multilingual models for vision and language! ([data](https://github.com/iacercalixto/visualsem))

* **Sep/2021** Collaborative article **Neural Natural Language Generation: A Survey on Multilinguality, Multimodality, Controllability and Learning** accepted for publication in the *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research* (JAIR) where we discuss the recent trends in neural approaches to natural language generation. More news soon!

* **May/2021** Book chapter **Natural language processing for mental disorders: an overview** accepted for publication in: *Natural Language Processing in Healthcare: A Special Focus on Low Resource Languages* (CRC Press). More news soon!

* **May/2021** Our paper [*Seeing past words: Testing the cross-modal capabilities of pretrained V&L models on counting tasks*](https://iwcs2021.github.io/proceedings/mmsr/pdf/2021.mmsr-1.4.pdf) was accepted for publication at the 'Beyond Language: Multimodal Semantic Representations' (**MMSR 2021**) Workshop. We release a counting probe dataset to be used in evaluating pretrained V&L models ([data](https://github.com/Heidelberg-NLP/counting-probe)).

* **Mar/2021** Paper accepted at **NAACL 2021**: [Wikipedia Entities as *Rendezvous* across Languages: Grounding Multilingual Language Models by Predicting Wikipedia Hyperlinks](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.286/) (code and data coming soon).

* **Feb/2021** I am guest lecturer in the [Erasmus Mundus European Masters on Technology for Translation and Interpreting](https://em-tti.eu/). I give lectures on Machine Translation and Machine Learning in the University of Wolverhampton.

* **Jan/2021** We published a pre-print on probing the counting capabilities of pretrained vision & language models: [*Seeing past words: Testing the cross-modal capabilities of pretrained V&L models?*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12352)

* **Sep/2020** We release the beta-version of the **VisualSem knowledge graph**, a multimodal and multilingual resource to support vision & language research: [*VisualSem: a high-quality knowledge graph for vision and language*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09150) ([code](https://github.com/iacercalixto/visualsem))

* **Sep/2020** Two papers accepted at **AACL 2020**: [*Are scene graphs good enough to improve Image Captioning?*](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.aacl-main.50/) and [*English intermediate-task training improves zero-shot cross-lingual transfer too.*](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.aacl-main.56/)

* **Aug/2020** I am co-organizer of the **Repl4NLP 2021** (*Representation Learning for NLP 2021*) workshop.

* **Jul/2020** I am Area Chair for *Language Grounding to Vision* at **EACL 2021**.

* **Aug/2019** I am Short-Term Scientific Mission Coordinator and member of the Management Committee of the [Multi3Generation COST Action][multi3generation].

* **Jun/2019** I have joined [Kyunghyun Cho][cho]'s group in New York University.

* **May/2019** Paper accepted at ACL 2019 where we propose a latent variable model
for multi-modal machine translation ([pre-print available here][acl2019_preprint] and code coming soon).

* **Mar/2019** I have joined [Raquel Fernández][raquel]'s group in the University of Amsterdam.

* **Feb/2019** I have received a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Global Fellowship][msca]!
I will be visiting the [New York University][nyu] [Centre for Data Science][nyu_cds],
[Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research][fair] in Paris,
just to return to the [University of Amsterdam][uva]!
My project is called **IMAGINE: Improving lAnguage Generation wIth world kNowledgE** and [more information is available here][imagine].

* **Jun/2018** I gave two lectures at the Summer School in Translation Technologies
organised by the [Faculty of Arts in Universidade do Porto][flup].

incorporate global visual features into neural machine translation.
([code][multimodal_nmt_git] and [paper][emnlp2017]).

* **Sep/2017** Paper accepted at RANLP 2017 where I propose a ranking model to
learn multilingual and multi-modal sentence embeddings.
