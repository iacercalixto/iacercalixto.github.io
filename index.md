# Projects

* 2019-2022 [IMAGINE][imagine]: Integrating multimodal, world and commonsense knowledge into language generation. **EU H2020 MSCA**

* 2019-2023 [Multi3Generation][multi3generation]: Multi-task, Multilingual, Multimodal Language Generation. **EU COST Action**

# News

* **Mar/2021** Paper accepted at **NAACL 2021**: [Wikipedia Entities as *Rendezvous* across Languages: Grounding Multilingual Language Models by Predicting Wikipedia Hyperlinks](/publications) (paper, code, and data coming soon!).

* **Feb/2021** I am guest lecturer in the [Erasmus Mundus European Masters on Technology for Translation and Interpreting](https://em-tti.eu/). I give lectures on Machine Translation and Machine Learning in the University of Wolverhampton.

* **Jan/2021** We published a pre-print on probing the counting capabilities of pretrained vision & language models: [*Seeing past words: Testing the cross-modal capabilities of pretrained V&L models?*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12352)

* **Sep/2020** We release the beta-version of the **VisualSem knowledge graph**, a multimodal and multilingual resource to support vision & language research: [*VisualSem: a high-quality knowledge graph for vision and language*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09150) ([code](https://github.com/iacercalixto/visualsem))

* **Sep/2020** Two papers accepted at **AACL 2020**: [*Are scene graphs good enough to improve Image Captioning?*](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.aacl-main.50/) and [*English intermediate-task training improves zero-shot cross-lingual transfer too.*](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.aacl-main.56/)

* **Aug/2020** I am co-organizer of the **Repl4NLP 2021** (*Representation Learning for NLP 2021*) workshop.

* **Jul/2020** I am Area Chair for *Language Grounding to Vision* at **EACL 2021**.

* **Aug/2019** I am Short-Term Scientific Mission Coordinator and member of the Management Committee of the [Multi3Generation COST Action][multi3generation].

* **Jun/2019** I have joined [Kyunghyun Cho][cho]'s group in New York University.

* **May/2019** Paper accepted at ACL 2019 where we propose a latent variable model
for multi-modal machine translation ([pre-print available here][acl2019_preprint] and code coming soon).

* **Mar/2019** I have joined [Raquel Fernández][raquel]'s group in the University of Amsterdam.

* **Feb/2019** I have received a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Global Fellowship][msca]!
I will be visiting the [New York University][nyu] [Centre for Data Science][nyu_cds],
[Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research][fair] in Paris,
just to return to the [University of Amsterdam][uva]!
My project is called **IMAGINE: Improving lAnguage Generation wIth world kNowledgE** and [more information is available here][imagine].

* **Jun/2018** I gave two lectures at the Summer School in Translation Technologies
organised by the [Faculty of Arts in Universidade do Porto][flup].
The lectures were on statistical and neural machine translation.

* **Mar/2018** I have joined [Khalil Sima’an][khalil]’s group in the University of Amsterdam!

* **Oct/2017** Best Long Paper Award at INLG 2017 in a collaboration with
[Thiago Castro Ferreira][thiago], Sander Wubben and Emiel Krahmer with paper
[Linguistic realisation as machine translation: Comparing different MT models for AMR-to-text generation][best_paper_award].

* **Sep/2017** Paper accepted at EMNLP 2017 where I study different strategies to
incorporate global visual features into neural machine translation.
([code][multimodal_nmt_git] and [paper][emnlp2017]).

* **Sep/2017** Paper accepted at RANLP 2017 where I propose a ranking model to
learn multilingual and multi-modal sentence embeddings.
([code][mlmme_git] and [paper][ranlp2017]).

* **Jul/2017** Paper accepted at ACL 2017 where I propose
a doubly-attentive decoder for multi-modal machine translation!
([code][multimodal_nmt_git] and [paper][acl2017]).

* **Apr/2017** Collaboration with **eBay Inc.** lead to two papers!
One [paper accepted at EACL 2017][eacl2017] and another [paper at the V&L workshop 2017][vl2017]!
