I am a *post-doctoral research associate* at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA]
where I work on *natural language processing* problems with a *multi-modal twist*.

Some example problems I am interested in are (multi-modal) machine translation and paraphrasing,
image description generation, and multi-modal graph representations.

I am generally interested in research at the intersection of __natural language processing__ and **computer vision**,
and in more practical terms in machine learning and representation learning, computational linguistics,
image processing, and using graphs in deep neural networks.

I am usually available in Science Park 107 (F2.11), Monday to Friday.
